              MANUAL_CHECK_P:  'Verify that the first link on the page is a "skip to main content" link and that the target of the skip link is a focusable element.',
              HIDDEN_S:        'One link that is hidden was not evaluated.',
              HIDDEN_P:        '%N_H links that are hidden were not evaluated.'

            NODE_RESULT_MESSAGES: {
              ELEMENT_PASS_1:   '"SkipTo" menu button provides navigation to main and navigation landmarks and headings on the page.',
              ELEMENT_PASS_2:   'Link references a target on the page; verify that the target is focusable and at the start of the main content of the page.',

              ELEMENT_HIDDEN_1: 'Link is hidden from assistive technologies and was not evaluated.',
              PAGE_PASS_1:      'Page includes a link or "SkipTo" script that provides a means of skipping to the main content of the page.',
              PAGE_FAIL_1:      'Link does not reference a valid target on the page.',

              'Most pages of websites typically have navigation menus, page headers and other repeated content before the main content of the page.',
              'For keyboard-only and screen reader users, a link or other means of skipping these types of content blocks makes it easy to go directly to the main content of the page, without first having to tab through the repeated content.'

              'Make the first link on the page an internal link that references a valid target element at the beginning of the main content of the page.',
              'The @id@ attribute is preferred method to identify the target element for the "Skip to main content" link.',
              'To make any target element focusable, add @tabindex="-1"@ to the element. If the target is an @a@ element, adding @tabindex="-1"@ will remove it from the tab order.',
              'If you use an @h1[id="main"]@ element as the target of the "Skip to main content" link, most screen readers will read the heading level and content when the user activates the skip to link.',
              'Use the "SkipTo" script, main and navigation landmarks and headings (H1-H2) to enable keyboard navigation from the "SkipTo" menu to all major sections of a page, including main content.',
              'The @name@ attribute can be used if the target is an @a@ element and is focusable (e.g. tabindex or non-empty @href@ value), but this technique is discouraged, since the @name@ attribute is being deprecated in HTML5.'
            ],
            MANUAL_CHECKS: [
              'Using only the keyboard, use the link or "SkipTo" menu to move focus to the main content of the page.',
              'After moving focus to the main content, the next tab should move you to the first link, form control or other interactive element after the main content.'
