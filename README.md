# AC-Check: A Chrome extension for web accessibility analysis, aggregation and report generation
Project made by Mikel Iturria and supervised by Juan Miguel LÃ³pez as the final degree project of a bachelor degree on Informatics engineering, with a mention on Software engineering for the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU).

The report of the project is available, in Spanish, at the next [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SsHwztz9aWI-KaMxSwsF6HW6rLIp7ULM/view?usp=sharing).

## The project

#### Why was the project made?
The aim of this project is making easier the analysis and the creation of a report for an accessibility tester. Also, being able to share that report without any problem. 

#### Features
This project has some interesting features:
- **Automatic generation of reports**: With just clicking a button in the extension, the API generates a report of the web where the user is located with the results for that web on the [AChecker](https://achecker.achecks.ca/checker/index.php) and [AccessMonitor](https://accessmonitor.acessibilidade.gov.pt/) reporters.
- **Manual agreggation of results**: The extension also can aggregate manual reports made and uploaded to the extension by different users without losing information.
- **It is possible to download and share the report**: Also, visualize it in the [W3C report tool](https://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/report-tool/).
- **Mark the conflictive elements**: The code of the conflictive elements detected by the analizers can be clcked and the extension will mark the element in the page adding a red border to it. You can see examples in the demo of the next section.


#### How it works?
A video demo of the project is available in the next [link](https://youtu.be/InkyZ-bUi78).

The API has also a documentation made with _Sphinx_. You can open it by opnening the _index.html_ in ``flask/docs/_build/html/index.html`` 

## Installation
In this section we will describe the instalation on Windows/Linux
#### Before starting 
Before starting the installation, the PC needs to have installed both Python and Git.

#### API installation
Firstly, we will clone the project.
```
git init;
git clone https://github.com/Itusil/TFG.git;
```

Once the project is cloned, we will prepare the API. For that purpouse, we will open the command line in _Linux_ or the PowerShell in _Windows_, and will enter inside the **Flask** folder of the project.

Only in _Windows_, we will change the execution policy of the PowerShell: 
```
powershell Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

Now, we will delete the **venv** and the **__pycache** folders. Once both folders are deleted, we will create the virtual enviroment:

###### Windows
```
py -3 -m venv venv
```
###### Linux
```
conda create -n tfg_iturria python=3.9
```

Now, we will activate the virtual enviroment and open it.
###### Windows
```
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```
###### Linux
```
source activate tfg_iturria
```

We will notice that the virtual enviroment is activated:

###### Windows

###### Linux

We will now install all the complements needed for the project. Inside the virtual enviroment we will run:

###### Windows and Linux
```
$ pip install Flask
$ pip install flask_cors
$ pip install bs4
$ pip install datetime
$ pip install selenium
$ pip install chromedriver-autoinstaller
```

Optionally (but reccomended) we set the enviroment to ``development``
###### Windows
```
$env:FLASK_ENV = "development"
```
###### Linux
```
export FLASK_ENV =development
```

Finally, only in _Linux_, we will give the ChromeDriver execution permission:
###### Linux
```
sudo chmod +x chromedriver
```

Now, we just need to run Flask:
###### Windows and Linux
```
flask run
```

The API will be working correctly:

#### Installation of the extension
The installation of the extension is really easy. First we visit ``chrome://extensions/``. Once there, we click in "development mode" and in "load unzipped".

We will choose the AC-Check folder of the root of the project and we will see that the extension has been correctly opened.

Now, if we visit any page, we will see the side bar created by the extension.

By clicking the icon on the navigation bar, the extension will switch off and the extension will no longer active.
